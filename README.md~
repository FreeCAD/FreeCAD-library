FreeCAD-library
===============

This repository contains a library of Parts to be used in FreeCAD. It is maintained by the community
of users of FreeCAD and is not part of the FreeCAD project, although it is made with the aim to be
used as a repository of parts by FreeCAD in the future.

Contributing to the library
---------------------------

If you are interested in contributing to this library, please ask for write access to this repository
on this FreeCAD forum thread: http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=4205

Each Part should be correctly named, and placed into subdirectories by family or type. They should also
be available in both .FcStd and .stp formats, and optionally in .stl format (because github lets you
visualize them). They should also be as simple as possible, and parametric
so users can easily change their dimensions. In the file properties of each .FcStd file, the author
should also be mentioned, and the license information if available.

Install
-------

The library is a simple container for FreeCAD (.fcstd) and STEP (.stp) files. You can download it
anywhere and import its files in your FreeCAD projects. Inside the library, there is also a FreeCAD
macro (PartsLibrary.FCMacro) that you can edit (you must change the path to your Library) and 
place in your FreeCAD macros folder. That macro creates a browser window inside FreeCAD, from which
you can easily add the parts by double-clicking them.
