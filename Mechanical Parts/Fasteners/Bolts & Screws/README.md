FreeCAD-library/Mechanical Parts/Fasteners/Bolts & Screws
=======================================================

This repository contains a library of bolts and screws to be used in FreeCAD. See the main repository for more information.

In most CAD systems, screw threads are never modelled because rendering many threaded screws in the same document would be too CPU intensive and would serve no purpose. These screws are intended to be used in assemblies and as such they are represented as cylindrical, with the nominal screw size as their outer diameter.

Fully modelled threaded bolts and screws may be uploaded into this repository but should have "_FT" (for fully threaded) appended to their filename to identify them.

The "Metric" folder contains metric screws while the "Unified" folder contains screws based on the [Unified Thread Standard (UTS)] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Thread_Standard).
