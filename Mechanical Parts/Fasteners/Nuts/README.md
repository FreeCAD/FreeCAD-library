FreeCAD-library/Mechanical Parts/Fasteners/Nuts
===============================================

This repository contains a library of nuts to be used in FreeCAD. See the main repository for more information.

In most CAD systems, screw threads are never modelled because rendering many threaded screws would be too CPU intensive and would serve no purpose. These nuts are intended to be used in assemblies and as such their holes are represented as cylindrical, with the nominal screw size as their inner diameter.

Fully modelled threaded nuts may be uploaded into this repository but should have "_FT" (for fully threaded) appended to their filename to identify them.

The "Metric" folder contains metric nuts while the "Unified" folder contains nuts based on the [Unified Thread Standard (UTS)] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Thread_Standard).
